## What skill we learn from this project
- Teamwork skills
- Project implementation skills
- Object-oriented programming skills
- Clean code skill

## What knowledge we have after this project
- Computer graphics use complex transformations to speed up drawing
- The computer screen consists of pixel points with specific coordinates on integers
- An image drawn from the combined pixel points
- In order for the image to move, we delete the old image and draw a new one continuously
