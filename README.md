## ⚡ Skills we had learn
- Teamwork skills
- Project implementation skills
- Object-oriented programming skills
- Clean code skill

## 🎓 Knowledge we got through course

- An image drawn from the combined pixel points
- In order for the image to move, we delete the old image and draw a new one continuously
